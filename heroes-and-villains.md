# Heroes and Villains
Glenn's brother is remodeling his nephew’s room. It is a super hero themed. He has been getting into comic books and super heros ever since he met Spiderman. 
He’s asked us to build him a way to look up superheros and the villians they’ve fought and defeated.

## The Challenge
In this challenge we’ll be searching and sorting lists of objects. We have a list of heros with their villians, the last time they fought, the number of times fought, 
and the number of wins.

## Creating a Test Case 
No matter the level you choose to work with write a test case before you start your code. Then write just enough code to pass the test. 
Once you have passing code refactor to pass other test cases.

## Level 1
Starting off in level 1 we need to be able to tell if a hero has fought a villian. Have the user input the hero’s name and the villain and then let the user know if that 
hero has faced that villian.

## A Step Further 
Going a step further allow the user to enter a hero and then produce a list of the villians they have faced and order them by the most recent time they have fought.

## Level 2
For level 2 we want to allow the user to enter a villian’s name and return a list of heros they have faced.

## A Step Further
Going a step further order the list of heroes by number of times the villian has fought the hero. Include the number of times the villian won.

## Level 3 
With the information provided if given a villian determine which hero is the most likely to win in a fight with that villian.

## A Step Further
Going a step further, predict the chances of hero and villian winning when the user provides a hero and a villian.
